# GPT-Llama2-Llama3-Llama3.1-Llama3.2_from_scratch

This project includes my own implementation of GPT and LLaMA 3.2, along with a step-by-step transition from GPT to LLaMA 3.2 through intermediate architectures.

There are a total of 4 notebooks:

1. **gpt-from-scratch.ipynb** – A standalone implementation of the GPT model.
2. **llama3.2-from-scratch.ipynb** – A standalone implementation of the LLaMA 3.2 architecture.
3. **convert_gpt_to_llama2.ipynb** – A step-by-step conversion from GPT to LLaMA 2.
4. **convert_llama2_to_llama3_3.2.ipynb** – A progressive transformation from LLaMA 2 to LLaMA 3, then to LLaMA 3.1, and finally to LLaMA 3.2.

This work is meant to help understand how transformer architectures evolve and which components are updated at each stage.
